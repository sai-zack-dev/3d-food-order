# 🍔 3D Food Ordering App 

A practice project using **React Native**, **Three Fiber**, and **Drei** to create a fun and interactive 3D food ordering experience. This app is a testbed for experimenting with 3D graphics in mobile development.

## 🚀 Features
- 📱 Mobile-first experience with React Native.
- 🎨 Interactive 3D food models for ordering.
- 🛠 Built using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Android:** An error occurs during the initial load, but the app functions properly afterward.  
- **iOS:** 3D models fail to load due to compatibility issues.  
  *Plan: Fix or switch to alternative 3D tools for better support.*

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/sai-zack-dev/3d-food-order.git
